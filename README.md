### Hi there,I am Noel Varghese 👋


:wink: I am an undergraduate student pursuing Btech in CSE specialization in Cyber Security, at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I am an a Cybersecurity enthusiast - having  having experience working in Secure Coding,OSINT,Pentesting & Threat Intelligence fields

:bulb: Now, I am branching my journey towards Blue Teaming, where I will be documenting my journey and cases I solve from LetsDefend and Rangeforce platforms,on my blog hosted on Gitbooks

👨‍💻️ Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia

## View my project 'Secode':A static code analyzer,that points insecure C language functions in your code and suggests secure alternatives - https://github.com/NoelV11/Secode

🕵 Contributed to Darkwebathon,hosted by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (@TeamATII).During this event,we the help of a 200+ search party scoured the Dark Web,pulled information from tools like Project Hades and Maltego,to identify individuals who operate in gambling,child porn and CSAM rings


👱 Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it

:sparkler: I am an advocate for incorporating women into the field of Cyber Security,owing to remove the gate barriers that they face.This led me to be a member of my University's Women in Cyber Security (WiCYS) Chapter.I try to contribute,to the best of my ability,for the good of this organization

:thought_balloon: Empowering them,by sharing nuggets of knowlege and providing them opportunities to forster their growth gives me immense joy
