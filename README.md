### Hi there,I am Noel Varghese ðŸ‘‹


I am an undergraduate student pursuing Btech in CSE specialization in Cyber Security, at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I am an Ethical Hacking enthusiast and enjoy playing CTF's.
I especially love CTF's that teach me new ways of enumeration and analysis.Additionally,I am a blogger on Medium,with article subjects centring around cyber security domains like network security and vulnerabilities.

Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia

View my project 'Secode':A static code analyzer,that points insecure C language functions in your code and suggests secure alternatives - https://github.com/NoelV11/Secode

Contributed to Darkwebathon,hosted by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (@TeamATII).During this event,we the help of a 200+ search party scoured the Dark Web,pulled information from tools like Project Hades and Maltego,to identify individuals who operate in gambling,child porn and CSAM rings

We did so by reverse searching SSH Keys,Email and Bitcoin addresses of these individuals, present on the Dark Web.We are proud of what we did,helping Law Enforcement to book these criminals to jail.

Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it
