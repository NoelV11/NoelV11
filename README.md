## 🌱 I'm currently learning

- Splunk SIEM
- Powershell
- Windows Active Directory

## View my project 'Secode':A static code analyzer,that points insecure C language functions in your code and suggests secure alternatives - https://github.com/NoelV11/Secode

👨‍💻️ Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia

🕵 Contributed to Darkwebathon,hosted by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (@TeamATII).During this event,we the help of a 200+ search party scoured the Dark Web,pulled information from tools like Project Hades and Maltego,to identify individuals who operate in gambling,child porn and CSAM rings

👱 Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it

:sparkler:Being an advocate for incorporating women into the field of Cyber Security, I persevere to remove the gate barriers that they face. This led me to be a member of my University's Women in Cyber Security (WiCYS) Chapter. I try to contribute, to the best of my ability, for this organization


:thought_balloon: Empowering them, by sharing nuggets of knowledge and providing opportunities to foster their learning and growth, gives me immense joy
