### Hi there,I am Noel Varghese ðŸ‘‹


I am undergraduate student pursuing Btech in CSE specialization in Cyber Security, at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I am an Ethical Hacking enthusiast and enjoy playing CTF's.
I especially love CTF's that teach me new ways of enumeration and analysis.Additionally,I am a blogger on Medium,with article subjects centring around cyber security domains like network security and vulnerabilities.

Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia


Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it
